VARIABLES:

- Think of them as storage containers for data in code
- 3 ways to create a variable: var/let/const statements
- Can define multiple variables in one statement but not recommended.
Example for a good multi variable declaration:

let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello':

Variable Naming:
- Name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
- The first character must not be a digit
- Cannot name a variable a name that is reserved and used by the language itself
- Variable names should have meaning that describes the data that it stores

Constants:
- To declare a constant(unchanging) variable, use const instead of let
Example:
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
- Uppercase constants:
  - Use constants for difficult values that are known before execution such as Hex colors
  - const COLOR_RED = '#F00';    (much easier to remmember COLOR_RED than the hex form)

let userName = 'John';
let admin = userName;
alert(Admin);
