1. Understand the problem
2. Plan
  - Does program have a UI?
  - What functionality will it have?
  - What inputs will program have?
  - Will the user enter input or get it from somewhere else
3. Divide
  - Break problems into sub problems
4. Pseudocode
  - Writing out logic for program in natural langauge



Example of working through a problem:
"Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number
the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for
the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print FizzBuzz."

- User enters a number
- Prints each number from one to number entered by uses, but for numbers that divide by 3
without a remainder print Fizz instead.
- Numbers divisible by 5 without remainder print Buzz
- If divisible by 3 and 5 with on remainder print FizzBuzz.

Code to complete this FizzBuzz Program:

let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter a number to be FizzBuzzed: ");

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i ++;) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
} else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
} else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
} else {
    console.log(i);
}
}
